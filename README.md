In this project we have created a binary tree with a list of function we were asked for:
<br>
* insert <br>
* size <br>
* root <br>
* left <br>
* right <br>
* print <br>
* parent <br>
* remove
<br>
We have created Tree.cpp and Tree.hpp under the namespace ariel,Also tested our tree with a list of tests, uploaded it to the "Badkan" test and checkedthere is no memory leak.
